# Analysis of Land Use in the United States (1948-2015)
This project serves as our final project for our economic data analysis (ECON6010) class during fall semester 2019. This project analyzes land use and agricultural employment in the United States from 1948-2015. We primarily focus on cropland, woodland, forests, special areas, and urban areas. Visualization and cleaning were the primary objectives, while analysis was secondary.

## Getting Started
The R-Markdown (.Rmd) file, EDA_FINAL_MARKDOWN.Rmd, contains all code necessary for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. The primary  land use data file is imported directly from the USDA's website and used thereafter in the .Rmd file. For the agricultural employment visualizations, you must download the PIE_DATA.xlsx.
